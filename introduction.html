    <div>
      <p>
        For as long as I can remember I was always lost in thought, I suppose
        even then I was curious about everything. <br />
        I recall the days I would ask my parents,"Why is the sky blue?" they
        would always give me the most ridiculous<br />
        answers, but before I babble on allow me to introduce myself.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        I am Osinachi-Osinachi Okwara if we are being formal and I am fourteen
        years old. I attend Greensprings School in Lagos but I live in Delta
        State, Warri. <br />
        You can only imagine how stressful the flights are to get there but I
        believe that the experiences have trained men to accept and be
        comfortable in uncomfortable situations. <br />
        I am someone who is now able to understand it takes a certain level of
        hardwork to achieve one's goals. <br />
        Although I am widely viewed as too serious, the opposite is acctually
        true. I enjoy relaxing and having fun, sometimes I even view it as the
        major reason for my procrastination <br />
        I have the inability to do what I say I will and it has become a
        recurring problem. However, I am now on the path to understand myself
        better, so for now that's it about me. <br />
        Now let's get to the fun stuff.
      </p>
      <u><h1>My Hobbies</h1></u>
      <p>
        Like I said earlier, I really enjoy having fun so it only makes sense I
        have a lot of hobbies. <br />
        One of the major ones is football. I fell in love with the beautiful
        game
        <br />
        from a very young age and I have never looked back since then. I watch
        it, play it and live it. <br />
        Although it's the dream, I doubt I have what it takes to realize it. I
        have dreamt of a thousand lives where I celebrate scoring a goal in
        front of my adoring fans, <br />
        thinking to myself,"I made it". Sadly, I might never get that chance but
        I will enjoy it while I can and reminisce when I can't anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another really big one is track, I am not sure when I became interested
        but I believe my love for this and sports in general <br />
        stems from an even greater desire to never lose. I train hard so that
        eventually I can be the best ,and judging from the results I can say I
        am well on my way there. <br />
        Alongside the few I have mentioned, I enjoy listening to music. It truly
        is food to the soul, as they say. Lastly, I love adventures because they
        allow me to be free which is something I crave.
      </p>
      <u><h1>My family</h1></u>
      <p>
        So far, I believe the only part of me I haven't explored is family. To
        me, family is a group of people who love unconditionally and that's who
        my family is to me. <br />
        I am the older one of <b>two boys</b>. My brother's name is Chinonso and
        we both attend Greensprings School but he is two years below me.<br />
        We get along very well amd have fun together even though we do tend to
        argue a lot. In some ways, he feels like my other half but I think
        that's how it's supposed to be with family. <br />
        I owe who I am today majorly to my mother and father; through the
        hardships they have both gone through they have taught me how to
        overcome them myself and for that, <br />
        I will always be grateful.
