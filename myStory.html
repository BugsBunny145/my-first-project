      The water filled my ears as I cotinued to grasp for breath, I struggled
      and struggled until... I blacked out. Before I go on, let's rewind a bit.
      <br />
      It was the summer of 2019 and I was travelling to the UK with an
      organization called Krypton. <br />
      Although I had gone abroad before this, I was very anxious at what awaited
      me but excited as well.<br />
      We went to the airport on that faithful day as we awaited the plane, when
      it finally came I had to say goodbye.<br />
      So with a heavy heart, I hugged my mother and brother goodbye amd went to
      board. Despite being anxious, I was also excited.

      When we got there, I found out we would be staying in a school for the
      time being, which was kind of weird but ,"what could I do?" <br />
      The school was huge and very interesting for a couple of days until... it
      finally happened. <br />
      I was told that we would go swimming very soon and I was extremely nervous
      but excied... if only I had known what was in store for me. <br />
      I got to the swimming pool and watched as people dove in one after the
      other and I wanted to join in, so I did and wow.. <br />
      The first thing I felt was the water fill my ears as I sruggled to
      breathe, until someone pulled me out. In a way it was exhilirating but
      mostly terrifying.
